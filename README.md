## Gazzella Pomodoro
Gazzella is a simple mindfulness and productivity tool that iterattes on the basic idea of the Pomodoro. If you're not familiar with it, the basic use of the Pomodoro gives a user 25 minutes of focused activity and a promised break of 5 minutes, then repeats this pattern for as long as the user desires. There are a large number of variations.

Gazzella keeps the spirit of a Pomodoro and can easily be used as such. However, the aim is also meant to help a user reflect on the tasks that they are doing during the 25-minute productivity blocks. What are they getting out of the task at hand? Have they hit a stopping point, or would it be better to continue for another period?

## Possible Next Steps  
- Addition of a graphical indicator to show how long the user has been doing the same task versus when pivots have taken place.
- By that token, the addition of means of naming new tasks and selecting existing ones to continue.
